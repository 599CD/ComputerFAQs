Q: I am using WordPerfect 6.1 for Windows 3.11 with my new Windows 95 operating system. It's not working properly, even though the Windows 95 documentation says it should. Is there something I'm doing wrong? > Alan T., Clarence NY.

A: Alan, not too long ago, Microsoft released a listing of Windows 3.11 programs that have shown to be incompatible (or at least have problems running with) Windows 95. Some of these include Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop, Borland C++, dBase, Cheyenne FaxServe, ARCserve, CorelDraw, Lotus cc:Mail and 1-2-3, McAfee VirusScan, Microsoft Backup, Encarta, FoxPro, Quick C, Novell WordPerfect, PowerSoft PowerBuilder, Symantec Central Point AntiVirus, PCTools, XTree Gold, Norton Utilities, and pcAnywhere. You can get more info, and a complete listing of these applications on Microsoft's home page at www.microsoft.com/windows/thirdparty.htm > rdr

TIP: If you would like to bypass the Windows 3.11 startup logo when you run Windows, all you have to do is type in "WIN :" at the DOS prompt (yes, that's "WIN" followed by a space and a colon). Do this only if you are not using an Amicron computer, in which case you should love the nice blue logo that greets you every day...

Q: I have lots of programs that I run every day. These programs are scattered throughout my system in various Windows program groups. Every time I want to run one, I have to go hunting through mazes of folders. It's really quite frustrating. I want to spend my time working, and not searching for application icons. > Joyce U., Kenmore NY

A: We hear you, Joyce. Windows is not the most easy to use interface (which is one of the benefits of Windows 95; it's interface is a lot easier to use once you get used to it). Here's what we recommend for you hearty Windows 3.1 users. Click on File and then New and create yourself a new Program Group. Name it "PROGRAMS". Keeping all of the letters in capitals will help you to find it later. Once you've created your new program group, open it up and stretch it across the top of your desktop. Now, go into each of your other program groups and copy the applications you use most into this new program group. This way, all of your applications are on one easy-to-find screen. (Oh, by the way, the best way to copy an icon is to hold down the CTRL key and drag the icon from one folder to another. This way you don't lose the original). Once this is done, simply maximize your new program group inside your Program Manager, and presto! No more hunting around through endless program groups. > mpr.

Q: My computer says "bad or missing command interpreter" when I turn it on. What does this mean? > Randy J., East Amherst NY A: Uh oh. You do have a boot disk...? What this means is that the file that your system needs to "boot" or "start" is missing or corrupt. You'll have to make a "boot disk" on another computer to see if you can get into your hard drive. Here's what you do. From another machine, put a disk in drive a: and type "format a: /s /u" and press enter. Once this is finished, take the disk, put it in your other machine, and restart it. Hopefully this will get you back online, but you should call one of our professional technicians to help repair your setup. >rdr (request document BOOTDISK.HLP for a step-by-step.)

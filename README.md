Frequently Asked Questions About Computer Technology

For those who are curious. I used to publish a newsletter by fax back in the 90s and early 00s. It was called ComputerFAQs, a double-play on words (FAQs being Frequently Asked Questions, and it was sent out by FAX. Get it?) I recently found a bunch of these issues online. I'm going to see if I can locate more. They're still worth a read. :)
